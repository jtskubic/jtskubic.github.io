It is now halfway through the fantasy season (more, but halfway seems a better line to draw) and still no DHTL power rankings. Like you, this means I do not know how bad my team is. How could I without the insightful eye of our commissioner?

So to help, I put a little something together. Very little. Note of caution, I did not check any of this.

First, who is the worst at doing the very basic job of just choosing which player to start?

So far, it seems I have been the worst at choosing who to start. Managing to routinely play myself and have an _entire_ bench group outscore who I started. However, it is not that much worse than everyone else and I think special recognition should go to Good King Wentzeslas who not only at one point must have been holding two kickers (or three?), but managed to choose the wrong one.

Now, how does our scoring look in general?

I won't explain how boxplots work, but suffice it to say The Fantasy Zucks have had one gigantic fuck-up. While HeadmasterFitzDurgin has such a wide range of outcomes he can't even have outliers.

Finally, halfway through the season, how competitive are we? Here is the average score differential for each manager:

If I had to bet on the final, this is definitely not the way I would, but I guess you could do worse.

For the record we have also had two toilet bowls this year, where the two worst teams played each other, but so far none featuring the two best teams. Which accurately sums up the league.
